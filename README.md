# üöÄ Databricks-Detla-Live-Tables-Project

**Databricks Declarative Pipelines (Delta Live Tables - DLT) project implementing a Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) for a sales data warehouse.**

This repository contains the full implementation of a robust data engineering pipeline built entirely using **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**. The solution processes streaming and batch sales, customer, and product data from raw sources into a final dimensional model optimized for business intelligence (BI) and analytics.

## ‚ú® Key Features & DLT Implementation

This project leverages DLT's core capabilities to ensure a reliable and maintainable data flow:

* **Medallion Architecture:** Data is strictly separated into **Bronze** (raw), **Silver** (clean/enriched), and **Gold** (curated/dimensional) layers.
* **Streaming Data Ingestion:** Uses DLT **Streaming Tables** to enable efficient, incremental data ingestion from source systems.
* **Data Quality Enforcement:** **DLT Expectations** are applied in the Bronze layer to validate data quality rules, allowing for automatic filtering or monitoring of corrupted records.
    * *Example:* Checking for non-null `product_id` or valid price ranges.
* **Complex Transformation Logic:** Utilizes the **`APPLY CHANGES INTO` (Auto CDC)** feature for two distinct purposes:
    * **SCD Type 1 (Upserts):** Maintaining the latest state of records in Silver enrichment tables.
    * **SCD Type 2 (History Tracking):** Creating and managing history-tracking dimension tables in the Gold layer (`dim_customers`, `dim_products`).

### Pipeline Lineage (DAG)

## üèóÔ∏è Gold Layer Curated Output

The Gold layer contains the final dimensional model, consisting of the `fact_sales` table and two history-tracking dimensions. A final aggregated materialized view, **`business_sales`**, is created for direct BI consumption.

### The `business_sales` Materialized View

This view joins the curated dimensional tables to calculate **total revenue** broken down by customer location and product category, providing a crucial business metric.

#### **Purpose**

To provide aggregated sales figures, answering: *"What is the total revenue generated by each product category across every customer region?"*
